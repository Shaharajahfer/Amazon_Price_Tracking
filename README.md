# Amazon_Price_Tracking
This project is carried out in python and web scraping using BeautifulSoup.

In amazon, the price of products varies dramatically from day-to-day. If price of a product drops, then we can buy it. We can do this by setting an email telling us "Low price alert".

Here the python bot constantly checking for the price and when the time is right, that is when the price of that product is less than our target price, it is going to alert using an email telling us to buy. The email is sent by using SMTP module.
