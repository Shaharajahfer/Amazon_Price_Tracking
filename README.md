# Amazon_Price_Tracking
This project is done using python and web scraping using BeautifulSoup.

In amazon, the price of products vary dramatically from day-to-day. We can set a price of a product in our mind. And if the price of that product drops to that price, then we can buy it. We can do this by setting an email telling us "Low price alert".
The python bot constantly checking for the price and when the time is right, that is when the price of product is less than our target price, it is going to alert using an email telling us to buy. The email is send using SMTP module.
