# Amazon_Price_Tracking

This project is done using Python and BeautifulSoup.

In amazon, the price of products varies dramatically from day-to-day. If the price of a product drops, then it is going to alert us using an email.

Here the python bot constantly checking for the price and when the time is right, that is when the price of that product is less than our target price, it is going to alert us using an email. This email is sent by using SMTP module.
